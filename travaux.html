                <h3>Passatemps</h3>
                <p>Passatemps was my first attempt at doing a website. The goal was to do a website from scratch, doing
                    all the research and the thinking for the visuals, doing the mock up and then of course coding the
                    website itself.<br>My group and i decided to keep the project alive because we liked the idea of it
                    : <b>a second-hand board game sales site</b>. It is now an on going project that we will continue
                    during our second year of computer science. During our first year, we worked on the project
                    management, thinking about every aspect and doing a functional specifications to prepare the
                    actual programming of the project. We are still in the very begining of the process, thinking about
                    the database structure, how we are going to managed our sprints using the scrum method and learning
                    new programming languages.

                <h3>Lecteur CD</h3>
                <p>As part of a Work and learning situation (SAE), I worked on a project in which I had to design
                    and build a <b>CD player in C++</b>, with a graphical interface using Qt. This gave me the
                    opportunity to
                    explore object-oriented C++ development, as well as Qt to create a clear and functional interface. I
                    learned how to manage the interaction of buttons (play, pause, stop, insert CD, etc.) with the
                    player's operation using Qt's signal and slot system. This project also allowed me to better
                    understand how to structure a graphical project in C++ and to put everything I had learned into
                    practice. I didn't have time to finish the project but i still think my team and i did a pretty good
                    job.</p>

                <h3>Database</h3>
                <p>A database was created by a group of developers, of which I am a member, to manage village and
                    competition data. We listened to the needs of a client (represented one of our teacher) and asked
                    questions to
                    design and create the most suitable database possible. We started with a conceptual data schema to
                    visualize the database. Then, a logical schema was created to create and manipulate the database. We
                    then created and populated the tables and ran queries to exploit the database.</p>
